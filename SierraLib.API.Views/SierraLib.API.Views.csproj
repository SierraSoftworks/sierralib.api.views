    <Description>
      This library provides a pair of interfaces and some extension methods which act as a framework
      on which you can build and maintain multiple, versioned, views into your core data models. It
      has been designed to work in concert with good API design patterns like versioned endpoints
      and semantic versioning to simplify the development of backwards compatible API surfaces as
      your services evolve.
